            <p>By using the site, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the site. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify, any part of the site, or our trademarks in any way. You are also not allowed to copy any contents of the site uploaded by users without their written permission. The site itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the Pemonlist team.</p>

            <p>The Pemonlist team is committed to ensuring that the site is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the site or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the site or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>

            <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that the Pemonlist team will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the site will require the site to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but the Pemonlist team cannot take responsibility for the site not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

            <p>If you’re using the site outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the site, or other third party charges. In using the site, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the site outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the site, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the site.</p>

            <p>Along the same lines, the Pemonlist team cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the site i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, the Pemonlist team cannot accept responsibility.</p>

            <p>With respect to the Pemonlist team’s responsibility for your use of the site, when you’re using the site, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The Pemonlist team accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the site.</p>

            <p>At some point, we may wish to update the site. The site and the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the site to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the site. The Pemonlist team does not promise that it will always update the site so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the site, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination the rights and licences granted to you in these terms will end.</p>

            <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
